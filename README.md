# MERN-Stack

Application being built to learn more in depth about how a Restful API built with Express, Node and Mongo can connect with the front end on React. This app is a mock social media app for developers to share their work experience etc.

This requires work to be done on the backend to create the app, then to connect it to the frontend. After doing this and learning some about how MERN stacks work, especially React, I'll look to apply the theory to the coursework I'm currently doing (the instagram clone)

# To start server and application

1. Install node modules in both backend and frontend(client)
2. In the terminal, type "npm run dev" to run the frontend and backend together

# Currently...

Managed to work in the ability to register as a new user using Axios.  You can now register yourself as a new user.  This doesn't go anywhere, yet, but you can see the result of this by viewing the console in the browser.
