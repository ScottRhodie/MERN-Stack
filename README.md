# MERN-Stack

Application being built to learn more in depth about how a Restful API built with Express, Node and Mongo can connect with the front end on React. This app is a mock social media app for developers to share their work experience etc.

This requires work to be done on the backend to create the app, then to connect it to the frontend. After doing this and learning some about how MERN stacks work, especially React, I'll look to apply the theory to the coursework I'm currently doing (the instagram clone)
